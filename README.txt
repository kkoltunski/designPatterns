This repository include basic small projects with design patterns implementations.
Purpose of this repository is to train design patterns and sometimes i used mental shortcuts or some software parts are abandoned.

2020.04.27 
-preparing repository structure;
-singleton design pattern update;
(creme de la creme of design patterns)

2020.04.28
-factory design pattern update;
(composite is something that anyone cane imagine for himself)

2020.05.04
-prototype design pattern update;
(prisms creator - only for regular prism)

2020.05.06
-builder design pattern update;
(cars catalogue - builder is used to create concrete informations of cars)
-repository structure update;

2020.05.10
-adapter design pattern update
(software to validate files format signature - adapter used to imaginary library mp3file)

2020.05.12
-decorator design pattern update
(mathematical collections - decorator used to add primes number algoritm in natural collection)

2020.05.15
-composit design pattern updadte
(company workers management - base software to develop new functionalities development)

2020.05.22
-proxy design pattern update - protection proxy implementation is similar to decorator
(software used to generate configuration file - protection proxy is used to check if user has access to file)

2020.05.26
-facade design pattern is skipped because it is used in few previous projects;
-flyweight design pattern update
(books management - e.g for library or web store)

2020.05.29
-repository structure update;
-bridge design pattern update - similar to adapter but it should be used to separate control interface from data interface
(stepper motor movement simulation - absolute mode use passed value ass new position, relative mode use passed value as offset)

2020.06.03
-template method design patter update
(random profibus dp frame generator)

2020.06.09
-strategy design pattern update
(boosted fstream library used to add operation (such as converter to upper cases, lower cases, separator) on files)

2020.06.09
-state design pattern is skipped because build of program look like strategy. 
Comparing to strategy - purpose of this design pattern is change internal state of context while strategy usage should change behavior of context.

2020.06.16
-chain of responsibility design pattern update
(project used to create user defined logs. Chain of responsibility divide whole process on 3 steps - user authentication, log creator, log saver.)

2020.06.17
-rebuilded solution for chain of responsibility design pattern
(account and taskHandler class were extracted to project chainOfResponsibility.Library, unit test project was created - chainOfResponsibility.UnitTests)

2020.06.24
-command design pattern update
(software to handle and navigate through created folders/files - first project created in full TDD metodology)

2020.07.02
-memento design pattern update 0.1 (TDD)
(TODO:  -finish memento class which is responsible for creating snapshot of actual settings value,
	-prepare UI to manage settings (changing values, saving and loading settings order);
